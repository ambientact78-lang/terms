          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the AssureDeal mobile application and related services
          (the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use
          the Service.

        <h2>1) Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          AssureDeal (“AssureDeal,” “we,” “us,” “our”) provides a platform that helps connect customers seeking services
          (such as roadside assistance and pre-purchase vehicle inspections) with independent mechanics or service providers (“Mechanics”).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3) Platform Role and Independent Providers</h2>
        <p>
          AssureDeal is a technology platform. <strong>Mechanics are independent third-party providers</strong>, not employees, agents,
          or partners of AssureDeal. AssureDeal does not perform the services and does not control how Mechanics complete jobs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4) Services</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Roadside help requests (e.g., jump start, tire change, lockout assistance, fuel delivery)</li>
          <li>Pre-purchase inspection requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Availability depends on provider coverage, scheduling, and other factors.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5) User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate information (location, vehicle details, notes, contact information)</li>
          <li>Use the Service safely and lawfully</li>
          <li>Treat Mechanics respectfully and avoid abusive, threatening, or unsafe behavior</li>
          <li>Follow instructions needed for a safe service experience (meeting location, vehicle access, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6) Pricing, Fees, and Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Pricing may be displayed in the app before you submit a request. Payments may be processed through a third-party
          payment processor (e.g., <strong>Stripe</strong>). AssureDeal does not store full payment card numbers on its servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          You authorize us and our payment processor to charge your selected payment method for the total amount shown
          (including any applicable taxes/fees) at the time of purchase.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7) Cancellations, Refunds, and Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          Cancellation and refund eligibility may depend on service status (for example, whether a mechanic has accepted
          or begun travel). If you have an issue with a job or payment, contact support and we will review it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8) Location and Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          Some features require access to device services such as <strong>location</strong> (to route help and coordinate service)
          and <strong>notifications</strong> (to send updates like acceptance/ETA). You can disable these in your device settings,
          but the Service may not function properly without them.
        </p>
